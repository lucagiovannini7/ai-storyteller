When The Lights Dimmed

It became clear to Madeline when the lights had dimmed. She sat in the garden, long forgotten by time, shrouded beneath dusky muslin veils, draped by the silence of an unattended afternoon. Across the jazz-swathed river, the sun was mellowing from a bright orange brilliance, to a softer, more distant pink — heralding the birth of twilight. 

A mirthful day had collapsed, entered a crepuscular state, and would soon lie in the arms of an unhurried night. Yet, there was still a slant of daylight clinging to the drawn-out shadows that danced on the hewn cobblestones. There was a solitary residue of warmth left by the sun, kindling life into the stone figures frosted by age and time.

Stricken with loneliness and nostalgia, Madeline pondered – was it the nature of carved beings to feel the empty chill from which they were hewn? Or was it a figment of her imagination, worn thin by the millstone of solitude? A flicker of melancholic thought that had slipped out unnoticed from the cracked vessels of her mortal heart?

She felt a sudden affinity with the desolate garden. She saw her life reflected in the marble statues, the once crafty, ardent love letters indented in time and space, now replaced by a stony silence that rustled with secret yearnings and deceptive equanimity. 

Delicately, she traced the contours of her own life forged, resonating with the echoes cast in the stone figures. She caressed their cold, cold complexion, whispering soundlessly, imbuing her warmth in their incompleteness—an intimate dialogue transcended in the dimming twilight, manifesting a reality beyond the seen. 

She imagined the night fishermen casting their nets far out into the inky vastness, where she would never tread, whispering their secrets to the inscrutable midnight stars. The stars, the fishermen, the stone figures, and her own solitary existence were somehow intertwined, stoked by a shared resonance of a solitary conception: an existence crippled by an absence.

The thought alleviated her loneliness momentarily, like the fugitive moonbeam slipping from the grasp of cirrus clouds, gracing the silent foreboding canvas beneath. Steeped in the twilight, carrying the weight of nostalgia in her heart, Madeline felt a yearning to transcend through time, to crack open its mystery, and extract her essence to find her innocent self etched in that distant past.

Just when she thought this, the light dimmed, plummeting into darkness, leaving behind only a radiant residue traced over the hill’s rim. She waited pensively in the quietude, holding her breath, anticipating the stunning panoply of night-time stars to shine a path to her salvation. 

In this transient beauty of the world in flux, Madeline realized: it was only when the lights had dimmed, that the obscure was made visible, and paradoxically, the seen faded into oblivion.
