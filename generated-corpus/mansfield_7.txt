Title: A Secret Sorrow: A Winter's Tale

All winter long, Clara sat by the frosted window, tracing the patterns of the melting frost with her index finger, drawing up enchanted tales that engrossed her in an inner world of magic and wonder. Each day when the sun shapely climbed above the jagged horizon, she would bundle herself in a thick shawl, her father's old work cap pulled snugly over her thinning chestnut locks, and venture out to the frozen garden.

The garden seemed frozen in time, a forgotten Eden under layers of frost and blanketed beneath the stillness of the winter air. The marble nymph that dominated the centre had developed a pearl veil, adding an extra sense of mystery to the usually vibrantly playful sculpture. Everything was so pristine, so untouched. The parallels between her life and the garden did not escape Clara.

A pernicious illness locked Clara into a slow-moving world, one where strength of heart often battled out the weakness of body. The garden was her sanctuary, the only place where she could escape the prison constructed by her body and blend into the normal rhythm of life. Clara loved the garden. It was a world of pure white, reminiscent of the invisible boundaries that marked her solitary existence. 

A family of robin redbreasts had taken up residence in the frozen yew tree, their vibrant plumage contrasted sharply against the frosted branches. Clara watched them with a longing and sadness that sunk deep into her marrow. Oh, how she wished to join the robins in their flight, to cut through the cold morning air without a care to oneâ€™s frailty.

She had a vision; she was in verdant summer instead of a freezing winter, running barefoot on a warm, grassy knoll, laughing with all her might, her affliction nothing but a fading memory. But as she opened her eyes, her visions were dashed against the harsh reality. The garden was still beautiful, but frozen hard, just like her dreams. 

In the crisp, freezing air, Clara felt a certain tranquility that was born from solitude, a quiet acceptance of fate that echoed the muffled silence of her frozen Eden. Still, a glimmer of hope ignited her spirit, as she watched the robin family flap their wings, their bodies too slight for the minus degrees, yet too full of life to accept the season's verdict. Clara turned her face upwards, letting the cold gnaw upon her cheeks, a harsh yet freeing sensation. 

Amidst the cold, silent world, the tiny burst of life in the form of robins painted a vivid mosaic of resilience against her windows of solitude. Clara's heart, captivated by the glimmery prospects of nature, fluttered along the tunes of winter, her spirit imbibing the lesson the tiny creatures imparted. 

And so, Clara's winter took on a new light, growing warmer despite the dipping temperatures. The frosted window became a panorama of stories, the silent robins, a beacon of hope. Adequately, her sorrow was painted over by the magic of acceptance and resilience, and to a hopeful belief in the soon coming spring.
