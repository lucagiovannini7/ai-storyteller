Title: The Sooty Depths of Stoke

In the profoundest of Staffordshire, under the pale veil of a grey sky riddled with soot and smoke, lay Potteries, the reclusive town of Stoke. Hidden in the shadowy expanse of five different towns, one boots-on-the-ground stranger paced hurriedly through the winding lanes, his tall hat and formal attire conspiring heavily against the strong gusts of wind. The Invisible Albert, they called him, a sobriquet chosen due to his third-hand, worn appearance as an enigmatic salesman who materialized only when required and vanished into the sooty mists thereafter.

One particular afternoon, Invisible Albert found himself anchoring his hat against the gust as he strode towards Maximus, the gargantuan pottery factory belching out monstrous coughs of smoke. Amidst the labyrinth of fiery kilns, lay an office showing signs of selective neglect. Threadbare carpets, faded wallpaper, and a desk that overlooked the glowing array of kilns- the personal cloister of Horatio, the factory supervisor, who possessed the girth of a barrel and the temperament of a bear with a thorn in its paw.

"Well now, if it isn't our Invisible Albert, making himself visible again," Horatio remarked, as he peered over his spectacles, a rare smile warming his roughened countenance. 

Albert showcased his products with humble redundancy, a task he had done a hundred times over. Perhaps it was the hypnotic glow from the kilns or the bewitching dance of the blue flames that ignited a spark of audacity within Albert, compelling him to do the unthinkable. He decided to sell a novelty item. But not just any object would do; no, it had to be a caricature figurine of Horatio himself.

He revealed the tiny clay supervisor, replete with rotund figure, bear-like demeanor, and an eternally stern countenance. Albert awaited Horatio's reaction with bated breath, unsure of where his confidence-fuelled dare would lead him. For the briefest of moments, a silence hung across the office, suspended in a time-loop of heightened suspense. Then, laughter erupted from Horatio, loud and hearty, gushing out as if from a dam set free.

While all the kilns glowed that day, the brightest spark was certainly the twinkle in Albert's eyes. The orders for Horatio figurines piled up, setting off a whimsical sales trend that turned Invisible Albert into Visible Albert.

Peering from his office window, Horatio watched Albert, the once notorious stranger, melt into the everyday fabric of Stoke. Within the dancing flames and the soot-laden air, there was an uncanny beauty in the mundanity of life. Even the invisible were destined to be seen. And as Horatio turned back to his dusty desk with the little clay doppelg√§nger stationed impeccably, he realised, in the unfathomable depths of Stoke, no one remained a stranger forever.
